             <h2 class="text-left">Personal<span class="gold-font">Trainer</span></h2>My name is Alexandra Rinaldo and I am a Personal Trainer, Group Fitness Instructor, and Bodybuilder. My Fitness journey began while I was in University. I stopped dancing and cheerleading when I started school at Wilfrid Laurier University, and after my first year I had gained the classic "freshmen fifteen." When I looked in the mirror I didn't recognize myself. When I did go to the gym in first year, I felt very intimidated. I wasn't really sure what I was doing, I didn't have a plan, and as a result, I didn't see much results. In second year, I decided this needed to change, and I was committed to being a better, healthier me. I started going to Group Fitness Classes at Wilfrid Laurier's Athletic Complex. I pretty much went to a class almost everyday. I would find the classes I enjoyed, and tried to get a mix of weight training classes, as well as cardio classes into my regular schedule. I really started to feel good about myself again, and I decided, if I was going to work so hard at the gym, I should change my diet to fit my new healthier lifestyle. This was when my passion for fitness and nutrition really started to grow. I did a lot of my own research about diet and nutrition, and because I was living on my own at school, I had a lot of control over what kinds of foods I would buy for myself and how I would prepare them. Even before I started bodybuilding, I was meal prepping and packing food for school. When I went to the doctor in second year for my yearly physical around my birthday in March, I had lost all the weight I had put on during first year, and then some! I had caught the fitness bug and I was loving it! That's when I decided that I was going to apply to be a fitness instructor for Laurier's gym.
In my third year, I started teaching classes, and that's when I knew that fitness was for me. I decided two months in to teaching classes that I wanted to be the Group Fitness Coordinator in my fourth year. I was hired to be the Coordinator in my first year of instructing. I was the Group Fitness Coordinator for 2 years at Laurier since I took a 5th year. In my last year at Laurier, I was teaching a minimum of 8 classes a week between Goodlife and Laurier. I had 5 classes a week of Zumba alone! I was such a popular Zumba instructor in the Kitchener/Waterloo area, that I mad two Zumba DVDs to sell to my Zumba following that I had developed.</p>

<p>Once, I graduated school I tried to figure out how I was going to make a career for myself in the fitness industry. That's when I decided to eventually get into personal training. It was while I was in personal training, that I finally developed the courage to start competing in bodybuilding shows. I did my first show in 3 months, and I did the GNC Inside Fitness Championship on November 8th 2014. For my show I lost about 20lbs and I was around 10% body fat. I made second callouts at my first show, and I cannot lie, I was definitely disappointed. But I fell in love with the sport of bodybuilding! Never has my body transformed so much! I learned so much from my coach in terms of nutrition and training, and I was the most fit I've ever been in my whole life!</p>
<p>Since then, I've been working my butt off for my next show. I've been building and growing to move into the Figure class and I'm excited to be doing the Oktoberfest Natural Classic this year!
That's a brief synopsis of my fitness journey so far, and it's only just the beginning! Every year since I decided to change my life in second year I've only become more fit, more knowledgeable, and more motivated to keep pushing my mental and physical limits! I honestly feel like every year as I get older, I become more self aware, more confident, and better looking! I've never felt more empowered and better about myself than I do now. I know I still have so much more room to learn and grow but I've never been more determined!</p>
